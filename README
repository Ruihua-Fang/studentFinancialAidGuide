    I submitted this project "Personalized Student Financial Aid Guide" at Hack for LA! at the National Day of Civic Hacking in June 1-2.  However, I ended up helping the Roosevelt Hight School kids to work on the "Watup: Boyle Heights" project and did not have enough time to work on this project and to submit it for competition. 
 
     At present, there is an incomplete outline for the project in the docs directory.  I will add more information shortly.  

     I am interested in making this app freely available so that students especially those from low income family can benefit from it. 

     If you are interested in participating, contributing, please contact me at FangRuihua@hotmail.com

Thanks and have a wonderful day,
Ruihua
